AngularJS Car Dealership Project
Today, you will build a simple car dealership website using AngularJS. This website will support the following features:

Immediate Search - Customers should be able to search for cars by entering a search string and the results should appear immediately.
Dropdown - If you select a car make from a dropdown list then corresponding cars should be displayed.
Modal Dialog - When a customer clicks on a car, a modal popup should appear with details on the car.
The app should take advantage of the following CarDealershipAPI:

/api/makes -- Returns a list of car makes.
/api/cars -- Returns a list of cars.
/api/cars/9 -- Returns details for a particular car.
Please make your website presentable -- in other words, not ugly :).
